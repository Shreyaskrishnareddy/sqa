## üöÄ Overview

The sqa project is a Python-based text processing and natural language understanding tool. It extracts text from various file formats, including PDFs, HTMLs, and XMLs, and utilizes sentence-transformers to convert the text into embeddings. The project leverages the power of the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model through the LangChain library to perform complex language tasks, such as text summarization and question answering.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Text Extraction**: The project includes functions to extract text from various file formats, including PDFs, HTMLs, and XMLs.
- **Text Embeddings**: The project utilizes sentence-transformers to convert text into embeddings, enabling the use of machine learning algorithms for text analysis.
- **OpenAI Integration**: The project integrates with the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model through the LangChain library, enabling the use of advanced language capabilities, such as text summarization and question answering.
- **Chunking and Embedding**: The project includes functions to chunk text into overlapping sections and convert these sections into embeddings.
